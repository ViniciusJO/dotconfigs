But what happens when you really need to shrink it? Well, if your target is the 6502, there&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/agsb/milliForth-6502" target="_blank">milliForth-6502</a>.</p>
<p>This is a port of <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/11/06/tiny-forth-could-be-the-smallest/">milliForth</a>, which is a fork of sectorforth. The sectorforth project set the standard, implementing a Forth so small it could fit in a 512-byte boot sector. The milliForth project took sectorforth and made it even smaller, weighing in at only 336 bytes. However, both milliForth and sectorforth are for the x86 architecture. With milliForth-6502, [Alvaro G. S. Barcellos] wanted to see how small he could make a 6502 implementation.</p>
<p><span id="more-772405"></span></p>
<p>So how big is the milliForth-6502 binary? Our tests indicate: 1,110 bytes. It won&#8217;t quite fit in a boot sector, but it&#8217;s pretty small!</p>
<p>Most of the code for milliForth-6502 is assembly code in <a href="https://github.com/agsb/milliForth-6502/blob/main/sector-6502.s" target="_blank">sector-6502.s</a>. This code is compiled using tools from the <a href="https://github.com/cc65/cc65" target="_blank">cc65</a> project. To run the code <a href="https://github.com/ShonFrazier/lib6502" target="_blank">lib6502</a> is used for 6502 emulation.</p>
<p>Emulation is all well and good as far as it goes, especially for development and testing, but we&#8217;d love to see this code running on a real 6502. Even better would be a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/09/19/riding-the-nostalgia-train-with-a-6502-from-the-ground-up/">6502 built from scratch</a>! If you get this code running we&#8217;d love to <a href="https://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip/">hear how it went</a>!</p>

<p>Despite the best efforts of the RepRap community over the last twenty years, self-replicating 3D printers have remained a stubbornly elusive goal, largely due to the difficulty of printing electronics. [Brian Minnick]’s <a href="https://clickprintchem.wordpress.com/2022/05/31/self-replicating-3d-printer-year-3-and-4-review/" target="_blank">fully-printed 3D printer</a> could eventually change that, and he’s already solved an impressive number of technical challenges in the process.<br /><br />[Brian]’s first step was to make a 3D-printable motor. Instead of the more conventional stepper motors, he designed a fully 3D-printed 3-pole brushed motor. The motor coils are made from solder paste, which the printer applies using a custom syringe-based extruder. The paste is then sintered at a moderate temperature, resulting in traces with a resistivity as low as 0.001 Ω mm, low enough to make effective magnetic coils.</p>
<p><span id="more-771525"></span>Brushed motors are less accurate than stepper motors, but they do have a particularly useful advantage here: their speed can be controlled simply by varying the voltage. This enables a purely electromechanical control system – no microcontroller on this printer! A 3D-printed data strip encodes instructions for the printer as holes in a plastic sheet, which open and close simple switches in the motor controller. These switches control the speed, direction, and duration of the motors’ movement, letting the data strip encode motion vectors.<br /><br />Remarkably, the hotend on this printer is also 3D-printed. [Brian] took advantage of the fact that PEEK’s melting point increases by about 110 ℃ when it’s annealed, which should allow an annealed hotend to print itself. So far it’s only extruded PLA, but the idea seems sound. <br /><br />The video below the break shows a single-axis proof of concept in action. We haven’t been able to find any documentation of a fully-functional 3D printer, but nevertheless, it’s an impressive demonstration. We&#8217;ve covered <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/09/12/the-most-self-replicating-reprap-yet/">similar printers</a> before, and if you make progress in this area, be sure to send us a <a href="https://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip/">tip</a>.</p>

But the cheapest ones are often cheap for a reason, and even though they work well for the price they won&#8217;t stand up to more advanced equipment. But missing features don&#8217;t have to stay missing forever, as <a href="https://www.edn.com/building-a-low-cost-precision-digital-oscilloscope/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s possible to augment them to get some of these features.</a> [Tommy&#8217;s] project shows you one way to make a silk purse from a sow&#8217;s ear, at least as it relates to oscilloscopes.</p>
<p>Most of the problem with these lower-cost tools is their low precision due to fewer bits of analog-digital conversion. They also tend to be quite noisy, further lowering the quality of the oscilloscope. [Tommy] is focusing his efforts on the DSO138-mini, an oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 100 kHz and an effective resolution of 10 bits. The first step is to add an anti-aliasing filter to the input, which is essentially a low-pass filter that removes high frequency components of the signal, which could cause a problem due to the lower resolution of the device. After that, digital post-processing is done on the output, which removes noise caused by the system&#8217;s power supply, among other things, and essentially acts as a second low-pass filter.</p>
<p><span id="more-772256"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.edn.com/building-a-low-cost-precision-digital-oscilloscope-part-2/" target="_blank">In part 2 of the project,</a> [Tommy] demonstrates the effectiveness of these two methods with experimental data, showing that a good percentage of the noise on a test signal has been removed from the output. All the more impressive here is that the only additional cost besides the inexpensive oscilloscope itself is for a ceramic capacitor that costs around a dollar. We were also impressed: [Tommy] is a junior in high school!</p>
<p>Presumably, you could apply these techniques to other inexpensive equipment, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/02/27/diy-stm32-scope-is-simple-cheap-and-featureful/">like this even cheaper oscilloscope based on the ESP32</a>.</p>

The Zynq is part FPGA and part CPU, and while it has been around for a while, we don&#8217;t see nearly as many projects about it as we&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>[Rich] covers everything from the power system to HDMI, USB, DDR RAM, and everything in between. By the end, he&#8217;s able to boot PetaLinux.</p>
<p><span id="more-772099"></span></p>
<p>The Zynq SoC includes an ARM Cortex-A9 Based APU and an Artix-7 FPGA. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/xilinx-acquisition.html" target="_blank">Xilinx was recently acquired by AMD</a>, which is why you might have remembered this as a Xilinx part.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve heard from [Rich] before. Back in 2021 we saw his <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/10/18/arduino-brings-usb-mouse-to-homebrew-computer/">Arduino Brings USB Mouse To Homebrew Computer</a>. Don&#8217;t miss his follow-up playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7sb-_3xk_CDW508xIo1T8Am7UTXk29is" target="_blank">Building on my Zynq-7000</a> in which he takes his Zynq-7000 board even further.</p>

<p>This non-planar slicer is built into a Jupyter notebook, which follows a relatively simple algorithm to automatically generate non-planar toolpaths for any model. It does this by first generating a tetrahedral mesh of the model and then calculating the shortest possible path through the model from any given tetrahedron to the print bed. Even with non-planar printing, you need to print from the print-bed up (or out).</p>
<p>Quite a lot of math is done to use these paths to calculate a deformation mesh, and we&#8217;ll leave that to [Joshua] to explain in his video below. After applying the deformation, he slices the resulting mesh in Cura, before the G-code goes back to Jupyter to be re-transformed, restoring the shape of the original mesh.</p>

<p>So yes, it is G-code bending as others have demonstrated before, but in a reproducible, streamlined, and straightforward workflow. Indeed, [Josh] credits much of the work to earlier work on the <a href="https://github.com/zhangty019/S3_DeformFDM" target="_blank">S^3-Slicer, which inspired</a> much of the logic and the name behind his S4 slicer. (Not S4 as in &#8220;more than S^3&#8221; but S4 as a contraction of &#8220;Simplified S^3&#8221;). Once again, open source allows for incremental innovation.</p>
<p>It is admittedly a computationally intensive process, and [Joshua] uses a simplified model of Benchy for this demo. This seems exactly the sort of thing we&#8217;d like to burn compute power on, though.</p>
<p>This sort of non-planar 3D printing is an exciting frontier, <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/non-planar-3d-printing/">one which we have covered befor</a>e. We&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/02/01/could-non-planar-infill-improve-the-strength-of-your-3d-prints/">techniques for non-planar infill</a>, or even to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/03/08/3d-printing-90-deg-overhangs-with-non-planar-slicing/">print overhangs on unmodified Cartesian printers</a>,  but this is probably the first time we&#8217;ve seen Benchy given the non-planar treatment. You can try <a href="https://github.com/jyjblrd/S4_Slicer" target="_blank">S4 slicer for yourself via GitHub</a>, or just watch the non-planar magic in action after the break.<span id="more-772345"></span></p>

But, in this case, the venerable MP3 firmware actually did update after a long absence. It&#8217;s great to see that good old <a href="https://www.rockbox.org/" target="_blank">Rockbox</a> is still kicking along. We <a href="https://hackaday.com/2005/08/18/hackaday-links-34/">first mentioned Rockbox</a> here at Hackaday approaching 20 years ago. How time flies. There used to be a whole &#8216;scene&#8217; around hacking Personal Media Players (PMPs), also known as &#8220;MP3 Players&#8221;. <span id="more-772387"></span></p>
<p>We tracked down Rockbox contributor [Solomon Peachy] to ask for some simple advice: If someone wants to install Rockbox on a personal media player today, what hardware should they buy? [Solomon] referred us to the <a href="https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/AIGOErosQK" target="_blank">AIGO EROS Q / EROS K</a>, which is the only compatible hardware still being manufactured and sold. Beyond that, if you want to buy compatible hardware, you&#8217;ll need to find some secondhand somewhere, such as eBay. See the <a href="https://www.rockbox.org/wiki/WebHome.html" target="_blank">Rockbox Wiki</a> for supported hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/05/16/silence-of-the-ipods-reflecting-on-the-ever-shifting-landscape-of-personal-media-consumption/">Smartphones and streaming services</a> have subsumed the single-purpose personal media player. Will you put the new Rockbox on something? Let us know in the comments.</p>

[Janne] thinks so, he has an espresso machine he enjoys but the default controls were not what he was looking for and so in true hacker fashion he <a href="https://something.fromnothing.blog/posts/frankenflair/" target="_blank">took what was and made it his own</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-772247"></span></p>
<p>This Kickstarter-born Flair 58 is a manual espresso machine with minimal moving parts and no electronics in its default configuration. An optional preheater was available, but it felt like an afterthought. He decided to add a bit more finesse into his solution, with a sleek touchscreen display controlling a custom heater board with closed-loop temperature control, and provisions to connect an external scale scale for precise pour measurements. We&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://hackaday.com/blog/?s=coffee+maker">coffee maker hacks</a> before, but this one certainly stands out for adding features absent from the machine’s initial design.</p>
<p>To accommodate the two custom PCBs and the touchscreen, [Janne] modified the machine’s frame. The Flair 58’s swooping curves posed a challenge, but instead of using an external enclosure, he shaped the PCBs to fit seamlessly within the machine’s structure. A wonderfully done hack given the open, exposed design of the base hardware.</p>
<p>Certainly head over to his site and check out this beautiful solution to improving on an existing device, and check out his other cool project based around <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/09/20/laser-fault-injection-now-with-optional-decapping/">laser fault injection</a>. All the hardware and software for this project is freely available over on his site so if you&#8217;d like to upgrade your machine be sure to go check it out.</p>
